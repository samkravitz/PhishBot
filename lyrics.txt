Welcome this is a Farmhouse We have cluster-flies, alas, and this time of year is bad
We are so very sorry There is little we can do but swat them
She didn't beg or not enough She didn't stay when things got tough I told a lie and she got mad She wasn't there when things got bad
I never ever saw the northern lights I never really heard of cluster-flies I never ever saw the stars so bright In the farmhouse things will be all right
Woke this morning to the stinging lash Every man rise from the ash Each betrayal begins with trust Every man returns to dust
I never ever saw the northern lights I never really heard of cluster-flies I never ever saw the stars so bright In the farmhouse things will be all right
Friends, If the lord ever comes descending from the skies in some fiery fashion as so many say he will You will not see me going joyously to greet him expecting my deliverance,but running for the hills
For if such a day should come to pass This is no God come to save the human race, but a big boat, like the ones our forefathers sailed having made it across the great ocean to our shores from outer space.
And friends when that boat finally comes ascending from the depths of our imagination to appear within our sight
We'll be born again as we've been so many times all throughout the ages
I'm feeling like I used to belong running around this place
My theory was 'head home before dawn' or end up without a space
My future was some merry-go-round on horses that learned to fly
My problem was I'd barely slow down mut found myself back at my -
Home, rest assured, And a life, unobscured
I'd toss way some days at a time into the folder now
Ain't feeling it
Stop stealing my lines over and over now
Outstanding with both hands in the night Looking for local life
Years older I resist and refine all that I can when I'm home, rest assured and a life, unobscured
Wide open door while I hide by the shore
My feelings are best left to the side
First I get off the road
I wish I had more time to wind but I haven't cracked that code
My history, I tend to revise with chapters upon the floor
I tell myself I'm part of a tribe and that I've been here before
Home, rest assured and a life, unobscured
Hide by the shore while outside of the door
When we find that we're not right, and with darkness lifted from our eyes, then we'll find what should come as no surprise…
We're on a big boat like the ones our forefathers sailed headed across the great ocean from our shores to outer space
Breath and burning we are made of sand
Slowly turning at the waves command
And what does it matter if the nightmares all came true?
The black clouds that scattered across the sky so there's nothing left we can do
Let's celebrate while the hurricane throws salt and water into the room
The canary died the healer lied
The yellow fields disappeared too soon
Mid-air voltage blooms and grows
Unstoppable, it's instant heat and as sinners plea on bended knee we'll be dancing here for days
Breath and Burning we are made of sand slowly turning at the waves command
And what does it matter what the end's in sight?
We're not going gently We're gonna rage with Page at the dying of the light!
The sudden unexpected fate of sunken ships was our future path
Your string of beads did nothing to prepare for you what was sure to pass
Shadow wheels in shipping lanes the angry winds blew straight from hell
And the tortoise pulls his head inside his shell
Breath and Burning we are made of sand slowly turning at the waves command
And what does it matter? It'll be over soon
Our heads on a platter so lets spin in the light of the moon
We've still got the light of the moon
We'll dance in the light of the moon
Breath and Burning
Climb that hill, stay on your feet, scramble for your footing when it gets too steep
You're on the highway now with higher hopes
While all around are rolling eggs with living yolks
You never get too sad, you never get too blue
It must be all the chemtrails raining down on you
The justice of the peace can't help you anymore
And they just took the covers off the justice of war
You got your nice shades on, and the worst days are gone
So now the band plays on, you got one life, blaze on
You got your nice shades on, and the worst days are gone
So now the band plays on, you got one life, blaze on
The storm is passing through, lay down your sticks and stones
The struggle's over now, we're all just flesh and bones
We were wrong before, it was wrong to trust
The shadows cast were only light and dust
And then one day you find to your intense delight
That three wrong turns can really make a right
So why not be like me? be proud of all your crimes
'Cause when I screw up once, I do it two more times
You got your nice shades on, and the worst days are gone
So now the band plays on, you got one life, blaze on
You got your nice shades on, and the worst days are gone
So now the band plays on, you got one life, blaze on
And we'll be dancing in the fields, running through the moor
Tripping on the barbed wire, buried near the shore
Blazing like a comet, brighter than the full moon
So you better get ready, 'cause a change is coming soon
I met a liar called the messiah
I got the frying pan, I wanted fire
I saw a red dress, I met a daughter
I got the quicksand, I prayed for water
You got your nice shades on, and the worst days are gone
So now the band plays on, you got one life, blaze on
You got your nice shades on, and the worst days are gone
So now the band plays on, you got one life, blaze on
When you're lost in the darkness and the loneliness cuts so deep when every breath is suffering
And you're longing for sleep you don't have to be alone
I've still got a kind word to spare
I've still have an ear to listen
I've got time
I'll wait with you till the tide turns Yes I will
I'll wait with you till the tide turns
I'll wait with you till the tide turns
Till the tide turns...
When the wolf is at your door
And the mirror holds your nightmare
There's no need to hide your tears
If it's too much for you to bear
You don't have to be alone
I'll still always be here for you
Together we can make it through
We've got time, yes we do
I'll wait with you till the tide turns
Yes I will
I'll wait with you till the tide turns
I'll wait with you till the tide turns
Till the tide turns...
You don't have to be alone
I'll still always be here for you
Together we can make it through
We've got time, yes we do
I'll wait with you till the tide turns
Yes I will
I'll wait with you till the tide turns
I'll wait with you till the tide turns
Till the tide turns...
People always surprising the things that they do
You think you got em' figured out and they'll show you what you knew
At first they may seem rational but wait a month or two
'Cause there's just no explaining the things people do
I had to get away I was losing my interest
Instead of expanding my world I was just scanning pinterest
So I left all these people I thought that I knew
'Cause there's just no explaining the things people do
I left for the road 'Cause I needed the mileage
Brought what I owned 'Cause I thought it was stylish
Well I don't miss the folks that I just left behind me
'Cause there's places I'm going kinda doubt they will find me
I never really felt that my life was in danger
But a shot to the gut by the hands of a stranger
Started me thinking what I already knew that there's just know explaining the things people do
Well I found a new place quickly I caught me a fast one
The people 'round here are the same as the last one
So I guess I'll keep moving and find a new crew 'Cause there's just no explaining the things people do
A flash of light another moment stolen from my soul
A thunderclap again I must surrender all control
Sudden noises startle me and strange things in my mind haunt me and I'm running scared
Running out of time
Running out of time
There are days when sunlight seems to lift me from my bed
And other times I face the light with eyelids full of lead
Light and dark pass quickly by with no dividing line
I follow but I'm running scared
Running out of time
How far have we fallen, how far can we go? How far will we fall, if there's nothing below
You stand on a rock, suspended in air
Eemblazoned with sunlight keenly aware that we've broken free, something has changed
A tear in the fabric, some tiles rearranged
We are the no men in no man's land
We are the no men in no man's land
Darkness the one thing we all understand
We are the no men in no man's land
We are the no men in no man's land
And the truth will rise above, and fiction fall beneath
Although the lies may bite, the truth has all the teeth
You see us as a window, you're happy that we're here
Exposed to all the elements, while inside all is clear
But if you hold a mirror, and you turn it to one side
The depth you see within at first, will find a place to hide
We are the no men in no man's land
The loss of all motion, the absence of sound
When there's no sun to circle around
We are the no men in no man's land
You're smiling at me from your picture frame and I miss you
My life keeps on changing but you stay the same I miss you
So many moments that we should have shared I miss you
And the days turn to years and it hasn't stopped yet the memories we shared I will never forget
No I will never forget there's a hole in my heart that will never be filled I miss you
This all should get easier but it never will I miss you
I float through the days and the long lonely nights I miss you
And I hear your footsteps you're coming down the stairs
Lost in your laughter the sun in your hair
A brief recollection the light in your eyes I see the reflection But it passes by
You're smiling at me from your picture frame and I miss you 
As I found out that I had a lot to learn
It turns out the tide had to take its turn
The line we had drawn wasn't straight enough
Though timelines were burned we rebuilt the trust
I always wanted it this way
I always hoped it'd be this way
I shielded my heart to make sense of this
The time spent apart that my conscience missed my mind 
Wandered thoughtlessly in that land of uncertainty
I always wanted it this way
I always wanted it this way
I've stayed at my station on the scene
And frayed like the circuits in between
And played as the part of a machine
And I found out that I had my mind to learn
Every morning I wake up and I whisper your name I miss you
You're in faces of people I see on the street
You're everywhere
You're everywhere
You're everywhere
Life in slow motion
Feet are in the clay I'm goin' nowhere
Been standin' here all day
I had a notion there was somethin' more to do
As I watched the water from the banks of the river it swelled and grew 
And I tilt to the left Lean to the right
Tilt to the left Lean to the right
Walked on coal and slept on glass
Emit swords of sap and daggers of light
And my heart is screamin' cause half of what I say is lies
And it takes so much to keep up this disguise
It takes so much to keep up this disguise
I see a doorway in the haze and I'm tryin' to get to it
The stars are peep holes in a wall but we can walk thru it
The memory's still so real, The memory's still so real
I guess it's never really over, even when its over
I'm vibrating with love and light Pulsating with love and light
In a world gone bad, a world gone bad, there must be something more than this
I'm vibrating with love and light Pulsating with love and light
In a world gone bad, a world gone bad, there must be something more than this
The trumpet call is sounding The trees are bending low There's a great fire in the distance There must be something more than this
And our shadows will all be dancing with red dust on clothes
When we leave that tornado upwards in the clouds and feel the sky
I'm vibrating with love and light Pulsating with love and light
In a world gone bad, a world gone bad, there must be something more than this
I'm vibrating with love and light Pulsating with love and light
In a world gone bad, a world gone bad, there must be something more than this
There must be something more than this...
Vibrating with love and light Pulsating with love and light
In a world gone bad, a world gone bad, there must be something more than this
Vibrating with love and light Pulsating with love and light
In a world gone bad, a world gone bad, there must be something more
And the rain came down and washed it all away
And the rain came down and washed it all away
And the rain came down and washed it all away
The clouds will open and the seas will rise
The ladders will come down from the skies
The glaciers will melt and the trees will fall
The trees will fall there's no more future and no more past
We'll be on our way back home at last
And the rain And the rain came down And the rain came down
I'm a sailor's girl, the best is yet to come
Rolling in my Fuego, I do my own stunts
I see guilty people, angels blowing horns
Some days it's just not worth gnawing through the straps
Freak out and throw stuff, World's Greatest Dad
Read a little book about Vlad the Impaler
Inside your Fuego, we keep it rolling
Inside your Fuego, we keep it rolling
Inside your Fuego, we keep it rolling
Inside your Fuego, we keep it rolling
I asked Diego if it was stolen
Inside your Fuego, we keep it rolling Rolling, rolling, rolling Diego, Diego, Diego
Dry mouth, push it out, I can hear my heart pound, a hero’s what I’m not
Voices scream, flashes flare, frozen as the people stare, my crucifixion shot
Friends were electric on the western side while triangles were shifting on the floor
Squeezing out the breath that I don’t have, they’re quiet now, they only want to more
And you step to the line
And you step to the line
Every shot I’ve taken has led me to this moment since I was four feet high
Big D is watching, I remember what he taught me, don’t let him see you cry
Try to see your future from the line
And you’re clinging to the notion you’ll be fine
But the circle’s getting smaller all the time
Try to see your future from the line
And you’re clinging to the notion you’ll be fine
But the circle’s getting smaller all the time
Dry mouth, push it out, I can hear my heart pound, a hero’s what I’m not
Voices scream, flashes flare, frozen as the people stare, my crucifiction shot
You try to see your future from the line
Clinging to the notion you’ll be fine
But the circle’s getting smaller all the time
You try to see your future from the line
And you’re clinging to the notion you’ll be fine
But the circle’s getting smaller all the time
You try to see your future from the line
You’re clinging to the notion you’ll be fine
But the circle’s getting smaller all the time
You try to see your future from the line
Clinging to the notion you’ll be fine
But the circle’s getting smaller...
No more promises that no one could keep
No more lies to keep us from sleep
No more phone calls when you don't say what you mean
I've got faith in a fairytale, devotion to a dream
It's today the vows are broken
It's today the charade is over
It's today the curtain's coming down
Now the battle-lines are chosen
It's today my eyes are open
It's today the time to turn around
No more knowing glances or places we can hide
No more chances to keep this thing alive
The two of us together it wasn't in the grand scheme
All it was was a fairytale and devotion to a dream
No more promises no more keeping score
No more wondering what I stay here for
We broke the awkward silence with polite and practiced lies while images occupied our minds
An uneventful voyage that stranded us upstream
All it was was a fairytale and devotion to a dream
Yesterday my path was chosen Yesterday my smile was frozen Yesterday my doors were closing down
Tomorrow I can cross the border it's today a new world-order
Yesterday my will was broken down I'll ignore where this is leading
Tomorrow glaciers are receding
I close my eyes as the curtain draws ear toward the tracks
And ever after the rhythm soars flyin' right past the facts
Hold the times that I brought to light keep the pattern till June
Make the other side right half the way to the Moon
Im old enough to repeat myself Im not tryin' to defend
Holdin' onto the thoughts I have back to circles again
Holdin' back the emotion train Headin' back to Duluth
All aboard for the tour ridin' next to the truth
I found a place that I cant explain in my state of mind
I move myself as I search the stone the winter queen looks up and sighs:
I wish that I controlled the skies for up above is where to stand to rule those who walk on the land
The summer queen flies by and sees her realm of butterflies and bees and said, I wish I lived below Instead I sail where breezes blow
And the rain came down it tried to seep into the ground but water deep pecked and poked
And sodden soil already soaked began to roil
The prince of silence walks below inside a cave of ice and snow he says "I wonder why?" but words are locked in glaciers, never heard
The prince of music on guitar neglects to play a single bar but music trapped inside his head resounds and fills the space instead
The winter queen looks up and sighs... For any lines to unwind
I grabbed some change when I thought I could
Left my wallet behind
I did my best to refine I put my shoes out to shine
A little star that reveals itself Little matter of time
Holdin' on to the thoughts I have/wheel I know
Not the devil I'll find
Raise the bar and roofbeams high
Help me carry this tune
Make the other side right Half the way to the moon
Now I'm mending things I broke inside I'm completing thoughts unspoken
Now I see that webs were woven Now I keep the windows open wide It's today...
You lift me up, you hired me and light my day, you fired me
But then you stole the sun, delighted me now the day is gone, you knighted me
It's dawning on me how it starts Your wisdom must be why it smarts
Some wholes sum as many parts
Sing Sing Monica Sing your song it really didn't last too long
Sing Sing Monica sing your song can you admit that you were wrong? Go back home where you belong
Sing Monica, Sing Monica...
You gave me one last taste, retreated me Then cut me off at the knees, defeated me
From your ivory tower, inspired me Then stole my manhood, desired me
It's setting in now how it ends you may have one it all depends have-nots have as many friends
Sing Sing Monica Sing your song it really didn't last too long
Sing Sing Monica sing your song can you admit that you were wrong? Go back home where you belong
Sadly she set me free... 
You charged me up, excited me upended and re-righted me you hooked me up, you wired me But when my tread was worn, retired me
I'm saying all this stuff because it's finally dawning on me how it was
Sing Monica, Sing Monica...
They're tying a blindfold cross my eyes I rest my face down Skidding on switchbacks near the sides Gonna try to bust out
Get up, jump out, don't wait, gotta get away
Hop off, roll down, spring up, live another day
Sprint on cobblestones past the tracks
They kept my money, and my water
Don’t wanna run ‘cuz I want it back But I know I really ought to
If I don't break away clean I might stray from the scene
Make an escape when it arrives: The 555
They bought my soul for a pile of cash Everybody else got paid out
They're closing in I gotta dash I gotta find a way out
Hop off, roll down, spring up, live another day
Get up, jump out, don't wait
If I don't break away clean I might stray from the scene
Make an escape when it arrives: The 555
Up all night and I'm waiting for you to come home Mind is racing and I'm wondering what I did wrong
Waiting all night Waiting all night Waiting all night
Where could you be I'm so alone Won't you please come home
Sun's coming up and I'm rolling over But I'm holding on
And I said I'm sorry But you went so far away Don’t know why you left me this way
Just sail on, sail on
Had to have that Had to have that
Your wombat had that
Had to have that Had to have that
Your wombat had that
You gotta take it with you when you're going forward
If you're moving on you've got to leave it behind
(Know you've got to leave it behind)
You gotta take it with you when you're going forward If you're moving on you've got to leave it behind
(Know you've got to leave it behind)
Your wombat You had that
Your wombat You had that
You gotta take it with you when you're going forward If you're moving on you've got to leave it behind
(Know you've got to leave it behind)
It's kinda like the theme from the "Fish" TV show You know - with Abe Vigoda
The "Fish" TV show You know - with Abe Vigoda
You gotta take it with you when you're going forward
If you're moving on you've got to leave it behind (Bring it forward or leave it behind)
Little red wagon took a big jump (Cuddly but deadly)
That pup was caught in a centrifuge (Herbivorous, crepuscular) Never did tumble over the side of the hill (Discovered by a man named Wilson)
Kept flying down to Baton Rouge
Spit out the seeds Gnaw on the pulp Suck on the juice And simmer the rinds
Look at everything you had to have Bring it forward Or leave it behind
Cuddly, but muscular, Herbivorous, crepuscular
Cuddly, but muscular, Herbivorous, crepuscular
Steal away, let’s steal a car You’ll never win a major only shooting par
Step outside, feel the sun It’s only you, be you, ‘cause you’re the only one
And it feels good ‘cause it feels good And it feels good
Nothing lasts, nothing stays caught in this procession of unchanging days
What’s new is old, what’s old is gone you’re pushed up to the edge, so put your wingsuit on Put your wingsuit on
And gliding away, you fly where you choose there’s nothing to say and nothing to lose
Steal away, paint the sky And gliding away, you fly where you choose
There’s nothing to say, and nothing to lose Time to put your wingsuit on
I was taught a month ago to bide my time and take it slow
But then I learned just yesterday to rush and never waste the day
Well I'm convinced the whole day long that all I learn is always wrong
And things are true that I forget but no one taught that to me yet
I was taught a month ago to bide my time and take it slow
But then I learned just yesterday to rush and never waste the day
Now I'm convinced the whole day long that all I learn is always wrong
And things are true that I forget but no one taught that to me yet
I ought to see the Man Mulcahey [8x]
Happy happy oh my friend Blow out candles once again
Leave the presents all inside Take my hand and let's take a ride Backwards down the number line
You were eight and I was nine Do you know what happened then Do you know why we're still friends
Laughing all these many years We've pushed through hardships tasted tears We made a promise one to keep I can still recite it in my sleep
Every time a birthday comes Call your friend and sing a song or whisper it in to his ears or write it down just don't miss a year
You decide what it contains, how long it goes But this remains The only rule is it begins Happy happy oh my friend
You decide what it contains, how long it goes But this remains The only rule is it begins Happy happy oh my friend
And all my friends come Backwards down the number line
You decide what it contains, how long it goes But this remains The only rule is it begins Happy happy oh my friend
You decide what it contains, how long it goes But this remains The only rule is it begins
And all my friends come Backwards down the number line
Got a blank space where my mind should be Got a cliff bar and some cold green tea Got clouds that seem to follow me Got strange demands piled up on me
Got memories, got memories Got memories, memories of being free
Gonna steal time from the faulty plan Gonna act as though I'm still a man Gonna give you one last chance to see Gonna shrug demands off of me
Gonna dream, gonna dream, gonna dream Gonna dream, dream of being free
Gonna steal time from the faulty plan 
Got a blank space where my mind should be
Joy is over there in her incredible clothes She has silver silk shimmering down to her toes
I was doing the best that I can, I suppose But that little girl dancer eventually grows, she grows
You can't imagine all the times that I tried to uncover the source of the tears that you cried
Let's throw it away and just go for a ride and you'd say okay but you'd keep it inside And I tried, I tried, I tried, I tried
I never thought I could have it so good You were the song that my soul understood
That time is a river that flows through the woods And it led us to places we both understood Would be gone before too long, would be gone before too long
When we were young we thought life was a game but then somebody leaves you and you're never the same
All of the places and people belong to the puzzle but one of the pieces is gone and it's you It's you, it's you, Joy, it's you
We want you to be happy, don't live inside the gloom We want you to be happy, come step outside your room We want you to be happy 'cause this is your song too
In time we'll weather this storm inside together You'll see the change when the sun shines through
We want you to be happy, don't live inside the gloom We want you to be happy, come step outside your room We want you to be happy 'cause this is your song too
This is your song too, this is your song too This is your song too, this is your song too This is your song too
Standing on the edge of the cliff, I start to slip Don't mind if I slide off
Now I feel my mood starts to lift, I find my grip And the screaming fades away below
I grab myself and spin me around, I start to sprint I climb down to steadier ground 
If I can bushwhack it on back to the shack behind those hills I'll find the world is finally still
Run through pale dark woods to that sugar shack Breathe warm steam and hide in that old sugar shack
Boiling heat, maple steam, frozen snow, then it flows When you leave your maple dream wait till spring to go again
A mosaic of lies I tried to arrange in ways that shelter the blame I thought I might have made off clear with all of the loot I plucked and ate all the fruit
Then I started hearing the yells and shattering plates Drowned out by your slithering stares I was followed and chased and caught and tied upBy the hay right until I made my escape
Run through pale dark woods to that sugar shack Breathe warm steam and hide in that old sugar shack
